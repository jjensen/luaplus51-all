This is LuaCom 1.3b2

* Installation Steps
--------------------

  1. Make sure that Lua is installed in your system.
  2. Edit the Makefile file to suit your environment.
     (in general, you only need to specify where Lua is installed)
  3. Run "nmake" from the luacom directory.


* What you get
--------------

  If "nmake" succeeds, you get:
        * the luacom interpreter and dll in ./bin
        * the luacom library in ./lib (luacom.lib)
        * include files in ./include
  These are the only directories you need for development.


* Tested Platforms
------------------

  Operating System:   MS Windows 2000/NT/95/98
  Lua version:        4.0/5.0
  Compiler:           MS Visual C++ 6.0 / MS Visual C++ 7.0


* If you have problems (and solutions!)
---------------------------------------

  If "nmake" fails, please let us know (luacom@tecgraf.puc-rio.br).
  If you make changes to "Makefile", please send them to us.
