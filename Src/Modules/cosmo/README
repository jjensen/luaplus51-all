Cosmo is a "safe templates" engine.  It allows you to fill nested
templates, providing many of the advantages of Turing-complete
template engines, without without the downside of allowing arbitrary
code in the templates.

The current version of Cosmo is 14.03.04. This release fixes a bug with the latest version of LPEG.

The previous version, 13.01.30, added support for Lua 5.2. Version 10.04.06 added
expressions to selectors $(\<exp\>), 
allowed nested \[\[ \]\] in templates, made commas between subtemplates 
optional, and added a second parameter to cosmo.yield that tells Cosmo 
the first parameter is a literal to be included in the expansion instead 
of an environment.
 
Cosmo is installed as a rock. To install the most recent release
do `luarocks install cosmo`. The Cosmo rock is in the standard
repository. Installation on UNIX-based systems need the gcc toolchain.
