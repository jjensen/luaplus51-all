0.4.1 - 2012-04-12
 * Fixes event_callback handling to handle the no-return-value case better
 * Cleans up timertest formatting
======
0.4.0 - 2012-04-10
 * Fixes buffer event tests to work with current bufferevent behavior
 * Fixed buffer event and related tests to be compatible with Lua 5.2
 * Makes core segment compatible with Lua 5.2
   * Remove use of 'module' in sources
   * Remove assumption that luaevent will set globals
     - Only 'core' will modify global table (creating luaevent.core)
 * Fixes bug in merge for receivePartial
======
0.3.2 - 2011-07-06
 * Fixed recorded version in Lua
0.3.1 - 2011-01-15
 * Merged all of luaevent-prosody (0.1.1) changes (missed updates)
0.3.0 - 2011-01-15
 * Fixed libevent 2.0 compilation errors
 * Merged all of luaevent-prosody (0.1.0) changes
 * Removes low-level read access to watermark & timeout values that break API
 * Switches to watermark write accessor function to avoid API break
======
luaevent-prosody 0.1.1 - 2010-02-25
 * Fix overflow with high event timeouts
======
luaevent-prosody 0.1.0 - 2010-02-15
 * Fixed stack slot leak in event callbacks
 * Fixed stack slot leak when error occurs in callback
 * Various compilation fixes for Windows/ANSI C
 * Silence some compiler warnings
 + Add base:loopexit() method, with timeout support
 + Add base:method() to discover backend in use
 + Add core.libevent_version() to detect libevent version
 + Add _NAME and _VERSION fields to module table
 + base:addevent() now accepts integer fd to watch
 + Switched from premake to standard Makefile for building
======
0.2.0 - 2007-09-21
 + Reorganized project to better fit GIT
 + Refactored and cleaned sources
   * Broke event_callback into its own source file
 + Added timer/timeout capabilities + minor test
 + Added event_buffer object
  * Can 'add' a sequence of strings/event_buffers
  * Can 'get_data', 'length','drain','close' and create new instances
  * Can 'readline', 'read' from file des, 'write' to file des
  * Added lunit tests for basic functions (read/write from/to FD)
======
0.1.2 - 2007-08-18
+ Setup system to use new coro management as described in COROUTINE_MANAGEMENT
  The callbacks are called from the event_loop 'thread' rather than that which they are
  created in.  This will prevent the self-resume problem as well as dead-thread problems.
- Recognized issues to fix in next release:
  * Socket/event closing needs to be cleaned
  * luaevent.lua needs refactoring
  * luaevent.[ch] need to be cleaned up
======
0.1.1 - 2007-06-13
+ Fixed event-handling code to cancel events on nothing being returned
+ Added socket/object cleanup.
+ Filed bug to libevent about the strange valgrind-released errors
- Recognized following issues:
  Timeouts needed
  Need to handle events setup from inside a coroutine... need to get a global Lua state from a thread...
======
0.1.0 - 2007-06-10 22:00 EST
Completed mostly working version
* Moved to a mode where addevent calls a callback  rather than it being instantiated within.
	If the callback returns -1, then no event is ever setup,
	Otherwise the integer value is used to setup the event.
  This allows for using coroutine.wrap rather than a cooked-up wrapper
* Tests work, although there are a few remaining issues:
* Need to figure a good way of preserving the event object,
  not sure if current method is good enough, since the socket
  is the only anchor, and it is only held inside the coro.. 
  circular reference, something that Lua 'handles' well.
* Doing more than the maximum sockets the process is allows
  causes strangeness to occur in libevent.. somehow
  it is getting around to epoll_add which is causing valgrind
  to barf.
* Added cheap protection code for failures in callback handlers
======
0.0.0 - 2007-06-10 12:00 EST
Initial public version, was broken due to self-resume coroutines
